        Constructor
        Any object instance must receive an ``problem`` parameter that is responsible
        for controlling the problem evaluation and next possible solutions. This parameter
        have two required functions:
            
            ExpandSolution(current): function that returns all possible solutions from 
            ``current`` state
            TestObjective(current,target): function that evaluates if ``current`` state
            corresponds to the ``target`` state

        The came_from list tells you where you came from, but not the direction you want to go. 
        That means it is backwards from what you want. The reconstructed path is backwards, 
        so I call reverse() at the end of reconstruct_path. (An alternative is to choose to store 
        the path backwards, and then when you implement object movement, tell the object to go to 
        the last location on the list instead of the first.)
